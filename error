he react-scripts package provided by Create React App requires a dependency:




[1]
[1]   "webpack": "4.44.2"
[1]
[1] Don't try to install it manually: your package manager does it automatically.
[1] However, a different version of webpack was detected higher up in the tree:
[1]
[1]   /home/react/nodemailer-node-esim-Medium/new_try2/React_node_email/backend/node_modules/webpack (version: 5.3.2)
[1]
[1] Manually installing incompatible versions is known to cause hard-to-debug issues.

[1] If you would prefer to ignore this check, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.
[1] That will permanently disable this message but you might encounter other issues.
[1]
[1] To fix the dependency tree, try following the steps below in the exact order:
[1]
[1]   1. Delete package-lock.json (not package.json!) and/or yarn.lock in your project folder.
[1]   2. Delete node_modules in your project folder.
[1]   3. Remove "webpack" from dependencies and/or devDependencies in the package.json file in your project folder.
[1]   4. Run npm install or yarn, depending on the package manager you use.
[1]
[1] In most cases, this should be enough to fix the problem.
